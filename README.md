# MHCLG CyberHealth Documentation

The MHCLG Cyber Health Framework is a self-assessment tool to help Local Authorities understand their cyber resilience. 

This project uses Django, which is a Python framework for building web applications. It is in the form of a MonoRepo containing the [application itself](CyberHealth/README.md), [it's acceptance tests](acceptance/README.md) and [accessibility tests](accessibility/README.md). 

## Application Components

Please read the `README.md` file in the following components of the application to understand how to install and how they are used:

* [CyberHealth Framework](CyberHealth/README.md)
* [Acceptance Tests](acceptance/README.md)
* [Accessibility Tests](accessibility/README.md)
