    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The PSN (Public Services Network) is a network operated by several suppliers for government that provides a trusted, reliable, cost-effective solution to departments, agencies, local authorities and other bodies that work in the public sector, which need to share information between themselves.</p>
    <p>This document is completed by any organisation wishing to connect to the PSN. It outlines conditions that you need to meet and the information that you need to provide. This information will be used to assess whether you may connect/continue to connect to PSN. The PSN team may also need to conduct an on-site assessment. You must be in possession of a PSN connection compliance certificate before you can connect to the PSN.</p>
    
    <p>You need to submit the following material as your application (and re-submission):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This document with all fields completed, including the signature of an authorised signatory for your organisation. Who signs the commitments will differ depending on the type of organisation. If you are a central government organisation with a Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO), your SIRO should sign the CoCo. If you are a local authority or other public sector organisation, you should have your chief executive sign the CoCo. If you are a supplier, the signatory should be a board-level individual who is empowered to make legal commitments on behalf of your organisation.</li>
        <li>An up-to-date network diagram.</li>
        <li>The Remediation Action Plan (RAP) from your most recent PSN compliance assessment, if applicable, and evidence that the remedial work was carried out as planned.</li>
        <li>A recent (within the last 12 months) IT Health Check (ITHC) report, plus a new RAP to address issues found. Weâ€™ve published IT Health Check (ITHC): supporting guidance to help organisations establish the scope and requirements for preparing an ITHC as part of a PSN compliance submission. It provides a minimum set of requirements that should be included.</li>
    </ul>
